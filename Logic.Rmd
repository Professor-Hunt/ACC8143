# Logical Fallacies

Logical fallacies are dangerous because people can use them unintentionally or worse intentionally because their argument is poor. Critical thinking and logic are inseparable, but I would argue that one cannot think critically without understanding logic.

This page lists common logical fallacies and gives examples. I plan on adding to this list until it is complete.

## The List

### **argumentum ad speculum**

#### Counterfactual fallacy

Occurs when someone states a fact, then states something would be true if the stated fact were not true without other evidence.

##### Common layout

-   A causes B

-   A is true

-   Therefore, B is true

**Fallacy**: Therefore, if counterfactual A was false, then counterfactual B would be false

##### Worse

-   A is true

-   B is true

**Fallacy**: Therefore, if counterfactual A was false, then counterfactual B would be false

**Counterfactual**: a conditional statement the first clause of which expresses something contrary to fact, as "If I had known."

**Example**: My cousin died of covid, but he would not have died if he were vaccinated.

-   Cousin died

-   Vaccines reduce the chance of death

**Fallacy**: My cousin would have lived, if he had taken the vaccine.
