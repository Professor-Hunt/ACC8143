# Logical Fallacies

Logical fallacies are dangerous because people can use them unintentionally or worse intentionally because their argument is poor. Critical thinking and logic are inseparable, but I would argue that one cannot think critically without understanding logic.

This page lists common logical fallacies and gives examples. I plan on adding to this list until it is complete.

#### Counterfactual fallacy

Occurs when someone states a fact, then states something would be true if the stated fact were not true without other evidence.

##### Common layout

-   A causes B

-   A is true

-   Therefore, B is true

**Fallacy**: Therefore, if counterfactual A was false, then counterfactual B would be false

##### Worse

-   A is true

-   B is true

**Fallacy**: Therefore, if counterfactual A was false, then counterfactual B would be false

**Counterfactual**: a conditional statement the first clause of which expresses something contrary to fact, as "If I had known."

**Example**: My cousin died of covid, but he would not have died if he were vaccinated.

-   Cousin died

-   Vaccines reduce the chance of death

**Fallacy**: My cousin would have lived, if he had taken the vaccine.

### Straw Man
```{=html}
</summary><p>
```

Occurs when someone argues against a made up argument, while completely side stepping the original argument.

##### Common layout

-   Person 1 asserts A

-   Person 2 argues an extreme version of A or something tangentially related B, but never addresses A.

**Example**:

-   Wife: I'd rather have a dog than a cat.

-   Husband: Why do you hate cats?

**Fallacy:** The wife never said that she hated cats, only that she preferred dogs. The husband either assumed or pretended that her argument was against cats instead of for dogs. Now the wife must argue that she doesn't hate cats --- which completely changes the course of the discussion.

**Other forms**:

-   Quoting an opponent's words out of context

-   Oversimplifying an opponent's argument, then attacking this oversimplified version.

-   Exaggerating (sometimes grossly exaggerating) an opponent's argument, then attacking this exaggerated version.
